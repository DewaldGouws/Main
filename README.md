# xamarin-forms-timesheet

This is a simple timesheet app to explore Xamarin.Forms. There is also a subsequent Xamarin iOS/Android implementation of the same app to allow for a comparison.

**Xamarin.Forms 1.3.1 Update**

The blog post that this repo supports was originally written against Xamarin.Forms 1.2.3. Out of curiosity, I recently dusted it off and realised the solution no longer builds with the latest toolchain. Accordingly, I upgraded Xamarin.Forms to the oldest version the current tooling I had supports, and the `xamarin-forms-1.3.1` branch was created. The untouched original version will remain in `master`.
